# Supervised Machine Learning

Module 19 Challenge assignment by Anna Barbera.  A project comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.
I created and compared two models on this data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier. Before I created, fit, and scored the models, I made a prediction as to which model I thought would perform better.

I wrote my prediction in the designated cells in my Jupyter Notebook, and provided justification for my educated guess.
Then, I split the data into training and testing sets.  Finally, I created a logistic regression model and fit the training data I created previously.  Afterwards, I did the same using a random forest classifier.
